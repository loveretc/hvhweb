# HvH webpage
Basic page for HvH sites, enjoy pasting. I don't need credits but it would be awesome. For any issues contact me on discord @revol#8379, not gonna update this since you don't need a super webpage for HvH.

<h2> How to customize it (for noobs) </h2>

- First check that the .css files are working, they should be linked automatically since they use ./css/
- Replace the title with
```javascript
var msg = "title"
```
  if you want to adjust the speed
  ```javascript
  var speed = "value"
  ```
- To change the favicon replace
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/ico" href="FAVICON">
```
- To change the background replace
```html
<img src="LINK/ROUTE" id="selector">
```
